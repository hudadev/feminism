    <h1 style="padding-left:100px" >INDIA</h1>

    

    <p style="padding:10px" id="csvData">

      <br>India is a country where gender inequality is very</br> 
      
      prominent. Females in India face gender inequality from</br>
      
      the day that they are born until their last day on </br>
      
      this earth. All kids in India are raised to think that there</br>  
      
      is more 
      value in male education,and because of this the </br>
      
        literacy rate in females is only about 65%. </br>
  
  Girls are put in the position where there is an ideology </br> 
  
    everywhere around them that they are brought into this world </br>
  
    to get married and then have kids. Since there is such an ideology, </br> 
    
    girls believe that they don’t need to have an education, </br> 
    
    it’s just a waste. There is a push for women to get married  </br>

      by the age of 18 and these marriages mostly end in early pregnancies.  </br>

      Some places in India even prohibit pregnant girls to attend school, </br> 
      
      so the girls that have to get married at a very young age, </br> 
      
      don’t even get the option to go to school. 

  Even the school environment </br> 

  is not designed for females to succeed. About 23 million girls </br>
  drop out of school because they start menstruating. There is a lack of  </br>
  hygiene in the schools as well as a lack of sanitary pads and female<br> hygiene 
  products available at the schools.</br>

  <h1 style = "padding-left:100px"> SAUDI ARABIA </h1>

  <p  style = "padding-left:10px"  id="csvData2">
    
  <br>Saudi Arabia is one of the countries where females have a male guardian</br>
  
   and they control their every move. This could be a husband,father,</br>
   
   son or a brother. Some of the things that women have to ask their male</br>
   
    guardian for permission are to travel, exit prison, marry, and every other </br>
    
    major decision. 

  Sometimes the male guardian can use this in a way that </br>
  
   the female can be free to do most things but mostly this is not the case.</br> 
   
   Most times, the male guardian won’t even let the female work unless a</br> 
   
   large portion of that money reaches him. Women activists
   
    have been trying </br>to get rid of this male guardianship system but sadly the government has </br>
    
    only made limited changes. 

  This system is extremely unfair to females </br>in so many different forms,females are not allowed

  to make their own choices </br> in life and they are born
  
  without a voice and they die without a voice. </br>
  
  Females raise their sons just to have them control their every move. </br>
  
  This gives an unnecessary amount of power to the males and they will</br> carry this around with them their whole life, feeling proud of all the power </br> they were born into even though they are controlling another human being </br> as if they were a pet.
