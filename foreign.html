    <td>,<p style="padding-left:130px"><br>India is a country where gender inequality is very 
      
      prominent. </br>Females in India face gender inequality from
      
      the day  that </br> they are born until their last day on 
      
      this earth. All kids in India </br>are raised to think that there 
      
      is more 
      value in male education,</br>and because of this the 
      
        literacy rate in females is only about 65%. </br>
  
  Girls are put in the position where there is an ideology </br> 
  
    everywhere around them that they are brought into this world </br>
  
    to get married and then have kids. Since there is such an ideology, </br> 
    
    girls believe that they don’t need to have an education,  
    
    it’s just a </br> waste. There is a push for women to get married  

      by the age of 18 </br>and these marriages mostly end in early pregnancies.  

      Some places</br> in India even prohibit pregnant girls to attend school, 
      
      so the girls </br> that have to get married at a very young age,  
      
      don’t even get the </br>option to go to school. 

  Even the school environment 

  is not designed</br> for females to succeed. About 23 million girls 

  drop out of school </br>because they start menstruating. There is a lack of
  hygiene in the </br> schools as well as a lack of sanitary pads and female hygiene 
  </br>products available at the schools.</br>

    <td><p style="padding-left:30px"><br>Saudi Arabia is one of the countries where females have a male guardian</br>
   and they control their every move. This could be a husband,father,</br>
 
  son or a brother. Some of the things that women have to ask their male</br>
 
   guardian for permission are to travel, exit prison, marry, and every other </br>
  
   major decision.
 
 Sometimes the male guardian can use this in a way that </br>
   the female can be free to do most things but mostly this is not the case.</br>
 
  Most times, the male guardian won’t even let the female work unless a</br>
 
  large portion of that money reaches him. Women activists
 
   have been</br> trying to get rid of this male guardianship system but sadly the government</br> has 
  
   only made limited changes.
 
 This system is extremely unfair to females</br> in so many different forms, females are not allowed
 
 to make their own </br> choices in life and they are born
  without a  voice and they die without a </br>voice.
  Females raise their sons just to have them control their every move. 
  </br>This gives an unnecessary amount of power to the males and they will carry</br> this around with them their whole life, feeling proud of all the power they </br>were born into even though they are controlling another human being as </br>if they were a pet.<p></td>








    
    <td><p style="padding-left:30px" > In Pakistan females opinions are ignored, they are either completely</br> ignored or people find a way to tell them that they are wrong. Although </br> it is viewed otherwise, Females have a huge role in Pakistani society, </br>they make  up almost 80% of the medical  front line workers. Even with </br>these stats their education is still unvalued and looked down upon. Only </br> about 25% of girls are able to finish elementary school.</br> 

Around 49% of females get pregnant before the age of 20 years old and</br> 21% of females get married before the age of 18. Males are willing to</br> threaten to kill, mentally/physically abuse or even torture females so </br>that their parents give more dowry after a marriage. </br></br></br></br></br></br>

    <td><p style="padding-left:130px; padding-top:30px;">In yemen a woman is so undervalued that legally they are considered</br> as half of a person. In court they are only considered to be half of a </br> person, this changes however when there is a man that can confirm </br>what the woman is claiming. Females are also mostly illiterate and</br> only 35% of them can read. 

This causes them to be looked down upon</br> even more because they can read and they are legally considered as half </br>of a person so people think that they are uneducated and unwise. This is </br>entirely  the fault of Yemen's society/government for not giving the right </br> resources or places for a woman to educate herself. 


 Child marriage is a </br> very common practice in Yeman. Almost half of the women in yemen </br>are forced to get married at a young age. Before marriage females are </br>controlled by their fathers and then after by their husbands. If a </br>woman wants to even get a passport, she has to ask her husband.</p>

<td><p>Although issues in human rights in Peru affect most of the population,</br> women are facing them to a greater extent. Around 33.7% of females </br>are illiterate in rural areas while only 10.9% of men are. In urban areas</br> however, the statistics are a little bit better, only 7.4% of women and 2.4% </br> of women are illiterate. Around 3 times as many women are illiterate</br> compared to men. About 10.1% of women that are from the ages 15-19</br> were mothers in 2017. 

Statistics also show that in 2019, around 22.8% </br> of women did not have their own incomes while only 9.7 men didn’t </br>have an income. In 2010 females with their own incomes had to work </br>35.9 hours a week unpaid.</p>
</td>

<td><p>Children in Chad are raised knowing that they might have to get married </br> at an extremely young age. About 66.9% of females that are  from the ages </br> 20-24 got married before 18 years of age. Around 179.4 per 1000 of females </br>had children before 18 years of age as well. These young girls have to leave</br> their education, community, family and much more because they have to</br> move to their husband's homes.

For the reason that they aren’t educated </br>yet, they focus on getting their families their needs so that they are healthy.</br> Since they can’t provide for the family, females are the people that take care</br> of the kids, take care of the house, make food, and get water.
