      Stereotypes in Women 
  </h2>

  <p name = "para"> 
    Stereotyping have been on the rise ever-since women started to work. These stereotypes really hurt us which affects us to lose confidence, leading to poor performance and a loss of interest in areas we can achieve so much. Some stereotypes that women face daily are: <br> 
    <br>
    1. <b> Ice Queen </b>: Some powerful women in many industries are addressed as Ice Queens that show successful women as unsympathetic business women. People call them "icy and unfeminine" and when they show a lot of emotions, they're "too fragile or unstable" which is a no-win situation for many women. Sometimes adopting masculine behaviours like being assertive, dominant, and agressive eventhough it makes women less likable are judged because they don't behave "lady-like". When we get tagged this way, it is really hard to take it off which limits the leadership effectiveness and advancements.  <br> <br>

    2. <b> Weak </b> : Women being "weak" is one of the most pervasive stereotype. We are assumed "weak" if we miss a deadline which brings frustration and disappointed to the male colleagues. We are assumed "weak" if we take breaks that we deserve to get. We are assumed "weak" if we "feminine" clothes. Even if we  fight really hard, we are always percieved as weak and it is still difficult to treat women equally.
    <br> <br>

    3. <b> Emotional </b> : women are perceied as "too emotional" that create "loss" and "weakness" and "fear" to success. Emotions are something everyone gets not just us. It is important to emotional at times because it helps to release a lot of stress that might be built up. These stereotypes have implications in real life. Women who express anger are seen as gender atypical and are punished: they lose status and are paid a lower salary, whereas angry men are given power and status.<br> <br>

    4. <b> Racial stereotypes </b> : some people think that other people's race makes them "assume that they are up to no good", but they're people like us who've got things to do and places to be. We place people into groups based on physical features of the face and body such as skin color, hair color and texture, eye shape, nose width, and lip fullness. <br> <br>

    How to prevent stereotypes?
  </h2>

  <p name = "para"> 
    We should be realise that making stereotypes really hurts people who we're victimizing. It can lead to less to no confidence, poor performance and a loss of interest in area of achievement. To prevent making stereotypes, we used educate ourselves. Reading this website is the first way to educate ourselves and stop biases and discrimination. We need to meet new people and try to see them as an individual, not part of a group. And, try to be self aware. Being self-aware is best because then you'll know when to stop judging people and think before speaking. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
