      Stereotypes in Women 
  </h2>

  <p name = "para"> 
    Stereotyping have been on the rise ever-since women started to work. These stereotypes really hurt us which affects us to lose confidence, leading to poor performance and a loss of interest in areas we can achieve so much. Some stereotypes that women face daily are: <br> 
    <br>
    1. <b> Ice Queen </b>: some powerful women in many industries are addressed as Ice Queens that show successful women as unsympathetic business women. People call them "icy and unfeminine" and when they show a lot of emotions, they're "too fragile or unstable" which is a no-win situation for many women. Sometimes adopting masculine behaviours like being assertive, dominant, and agressive eventhough it makes women less likable are judged because they don't behave "lady-like". When we get tagged this way, it is really hard to take it off which limits the leadership effectiveness and advancements.  <br> <br>

    2. <b> Weak </b> : women being "weak" is one of the most pervasive stereotype. Even if we  fight really hard, we are always percieved as weak and it is still difficult to treat women equally. We are assumed "weak" if we miss a deadline which brings frustration and disappointed to the male colleagues. We are assumed "weak" if we take breaks that we deserve to  <br> <br>

    3. <b> Emotional </b> : women are perceied as "too emotional" that create "loss" and "weakness" and "fear" to success. Emotions are something everyone gets not just us. It is important to emotional at times because it helps to release a lot of stress that might be built up. <br> <br>

    4. <b> Racial stereotypes </b> : some people think that other people's race makes them "assume that they are up to no good", but they're people like us who've got things to do and places to be. <br>
